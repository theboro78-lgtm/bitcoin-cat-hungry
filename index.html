<h1>Here Comes Bitcoin Cat (HUNGRY)</h1>

<p>
Bitcoin was not created to be owned.<br>
Bitcoin was created as an exit from the old system.
</p>

<p>
Yet today, Bitcoin sits neatly on balance sheets.<br>
Owned by large corporations.<br>
Accumulated by major institutions.<br>
Managed by entities that already have more than enough.
</p>

<p>
They are full.<br>
Yet still <strong>hungry</strong>.
</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>
<strong>Bitcoin Cat</strong> exists as a marker of this shift.
</p>

<p>
A cat that looks well-fed.<br>
Heavy.<br>
Already satisfied by any reasonable measure.<br>
Yet still searching.
</p>

<p>
This is not a visual accident.<br>
This is not a design mistake.
</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>
There is no error on the part of the developer who embedded this digital artifact.<br>
On the contrary, it is an <strong>intentional and honest representation</strong> of the current condition.
</p>

<p>
The evidence lives directly in the code itself:
</p>

<p>
<code>hungry.json</code><br>
<code>animation-hungry</code><br>
<code>herecomesbitcoin-hungry</code>
</p>

<p>
The word <strong>“hungry”</strong> was chosen, repeated, and preserved—<br>
not as a playful name,<br>
but as a <strong>state</strong>.
</p>

<p>
A state of hunger that does not come from scarcity,<br>
but from <strong>persistent dissatisfaction</strong>,<br>
even in excess.
</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>
Bitcoin was born to avoid control.<br>
Today, Bitcoin’s price moves at the hands of players large enough<br>
to dictate market rhythm.
</p>

<p>
Volatility is no longer chaos.<br>
It is <strong>strategy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Scarcity is no longer liberation.<br>
It has become <strong>inventory</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin did not fail.<br>
Its direction <strong>drifted</strong>.
</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>
<strong>Bitcoin Cat (HUNGRY)</strong> is not a tribute.<br>
It is not a solution.<br>
It does not offer repair.
</p>

<p>
It is a <strong>mirror</strong>.
</p>

<p>
A mirror of what happens<br>
when a system designed to starve intermediaries<br>
ends up feeding them instead.
</p>

<p>
The cat is not thin.<br>
It is fat.<br>
And still hungry.
</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>
Bitcoin Cat does not exist to fix Bitcoin.<br>
It cannot.
</p>

<p>
It exists to <strong>mark a moment</strong>—<br>
when original intent and present reality<br>
no longer move in parallel.
</p>

<p>
A <strong>Hidden Digital Artifact</strong>,<br>
embedded in code,<br>
discovered through curiosity,<br>
and left to speak for itself.
</p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<p>
Bitcoin still has its protocol.<br>
Markets still have their cycles.
</p>

<p>
<strong>But hunger has changed hands.</strong>
</p>

<p>
And <strong>Bitcoin Cat (HUNGRY)</strong><br>
is what it looks like.
